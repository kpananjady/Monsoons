      <h2 class="subhead">2019 has been a tricky year for the Indian summer monsoon and the many that rely on it for their lives and livelihoods. What can an analysis of 145 years of data tell us about what could be happening right now? </h2>

      <p class="body-text serif">It's summer in India, and anxiety about the monsoon is running high. Chennai, a highly populated South Indian state capital, suffered severe water shortages last month, a bad omen for the rest of the country. This project goes into monsoon headlines and tries to visualize the analysis that went into their creation.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">In these visualizations and analyses, I'm using all India monthly rainfall data in tenths of milimeters compiled by the Indian Institute of Tropical Metereology. The data run from 1871-2016, which is great, but is in ugly pdf form, which is not so great. If you want the csv file find it in my github repo!</p>

        <p class="chart-title">Some definitions. What is the monsoon?</p>
        <p class="chart-subhead">This is an uninspired scrawl to get a quick glimpse of what rains in India have looked like over the past ten years. </p>

      <div class="story-body">
        <p class="body-text serif">From this graph, the monsoon looks charmingly regular. But while rains over a year follow general peaks and troughs, we're only really interested in the summer months.</p>

      <div class="chart-section">
        <p class="chart-title">June, July, August and September are the monsoon months, and it's their variability that we care about.</p>
        <p class="chart-subhead">From this graph, we can see that June and September have the highest variability of any of the monsoon months, which July and August typically receive the most rain.</p>

      </div>
      
      <p class="chart-title">But this leaves out how these distributions occured across the years. Does below monthly average rain in June mean that you'll definitely have below monthly average rain in July, and so on and so forth?</p>
      <p class="chart-subhead">From this graph, we can see that below average rain in June  doesn't necessarily mean that you'll have below average rain in July. That's good news for us in 2019.</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">So what's all the hype about July rainfall?</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">Below average July rainfall is strongly correlated with drought. Here's June and August below, for comparison.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">This is why news outlets have been tracking July rainfall so closely.</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">One last thing.</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">Notice how those drought years are clustering towards the end there? Yeah.

Yeah, that orange line.</p>
